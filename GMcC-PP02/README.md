  * Python 3+ is required. No external libraries used.

## Execution & Output

The program is made up of several modules. The user interacts with the file `driver.py`. To learn more, please type the following at the command prompt: 

```
>> python driver.py -h
```

and the following message will be displayed.

```
usage: driver.py [-f] (-file )
```

The code is delivered as a zipped folder. Once unzipped it has the following directory structure:

```
├── GMcC-PP02
│   ├── README.md

```
To run the program change directories to `GMcC-PP02` and execute the file `driver.py` as described. For purposes of this assignment (to test parsing of input and writing of output) please enter the following at the command prompt:

```
>> python driver.py -file
```
