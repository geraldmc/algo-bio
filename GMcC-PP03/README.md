## Requirements

  * Python 3+ is required. No external libraries used.

## Execution & Output

The program is made up of several modules. The user interacts with the file `driver.py`. To learn more, please type the following at the command prompt: 

```
>> python driver.py -h
```

and the following message will be displayed.

```
>> python driver.py -h

usage: driver.py [-h] -file

Exercise in hashing.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -file       provide a path to a file containing hash input.
```

The code is delivered as a zipped folder. Once unzipped it has the following directory structure:

```
.
├── README.md
├── analysis
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── metrics.py
├── data
│   └── Input.txt
├── docs
│   └── Proj3.pdf
├── driver.py
├── filehandler
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── io.py
└── perf.py
```
To run the program change directories to `GMcC-PP03` and execute the file `driver.py` as described. 

```
>> python driver.py -file
```

You will be prompted for a path to the input file.

```
Enter file input path: ./data/Input.txt
```
